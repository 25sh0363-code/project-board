Genetic mutations leading to uncontrolled growth and metastasis

4. Common Types
Breast, lung, colorectal, prostate cancers most common. Childhood leukemias and brain tumors.

5. Risk Factors
Tobacco, alcohol, obesity, diet, inactivity, UV exposure, genetics, infections, environmental factors

6. Manifestations

7. Diagnosis
Comprehensive diagnostic capabilities including imaging, biopsy, molecular testing

8. Treatment
Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy. Provincial cancer centers provide coordinated care.

9. Current Trends
Steady incidence
Improving survival rates
Strong screening programs
Research leadership
Some disparities in Indigenous populations

10. Future Projections
Precision medicine, improved immunotherapies, AI integration, expanded screening

11. Challenges
Geographic access disparities
Wait times for some procedures
Indigenous health equity
Rising costs

Tobacco control, healthy lifestyle, vaccination (HPV, Hepatitis B), screening (breast, cervical, colorectal)

13. Public Health
Canadian Cancer Society, provincial cancer agencies, Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, screening programs, research funding

14. Summary
Canada addresses cancer through universal healthcare, provincial cancer centers, comprehensive screening, strong research, and efforts to address geographic and Indigenous health disparities.
