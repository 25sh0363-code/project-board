HIV/AIDS in America — Knowledge Base
1. Overview
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) attacks the immune system. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is advanced HIV infection. HIV transmitted through blood, sexual contact, mother-to-child.

2. Historical Context
First cases recognized early 1980s. HIV/AIDS epidemic devastated communities, particularly gay men. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) transformed HIV from death sentence to manageable chronic condition.

3. Pathophysiology
HIV infects CD4 T-cells, progressively weakening immune system. Without treatment, progresses to AIDS with opportunistic infections.

4. Transmission
Unprotected sexual contact, needle sharing, mother-to-child, blood transfusions (now rare due to screening)

5. Clinical Manifestations
Acute HIV: flu-like symptoms
Chronic HIV: often asymptomatic for years
AIDS: opportunistic infections, cancers, severe weight loss

6. Diagnosis
HIV antibody/antigen tests, viral load testing, CD4 count

7. Treatment
Antiretroviral therapy (ART): combination medications suppress virus
Treatment as prevention: undetectable = untransmittable (U=U)
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevents infection
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after potential exposure

8. Current Trends
New infections declining but persistent
Disparities: higher rates in Black, Hispanic, MSM, Southern states
Aging HIV population
Stigma remains barrier

9. Future Projections
Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative
Long-acting ART formulations
Vaccine research ongoing
Cure research

10. Challenges
Reaching underserved populations
Stigma
Treatment adherence
Healthcare access
Health disparities

11. Prevention
Condom use, PrEP, needle exchange, testing, treatment as prevention, education

12. Public Health
CDC HIV programs, Ryan White Program, state/local initiatives, research funding

13. Summary
HIV/AIDS in America transformed from epidemic crisis to manageable chronic condition through ART. Challenges remain in achieving equity and elimination goals.
