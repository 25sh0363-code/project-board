Cancer in America — Knowledge Base
1. Conceptual Overview
Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and spread. It affects multiple organ systems and represents a major health burden in America.

2. Historical Context
Cancer has evolved from often-fatal diagnosis to increasingly manageable condition through advances in detection and treatment. America leads globally in cancer research and treatment innovation.

3. Pathophysiology
Genetic mutations lead to uncontrolled cell division, tumor formation, and potential metastasis.

4. Common Cancer Types
Breast, lung, prostate, colorectal cancers most common. Childhood cancers include leukemias and brain tumors.

5. Risk Factors
Tobacco, alcohol, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, infections (HPV, HBV, HCV)

6. Clinical Manifestations
General: unexplained weight loss, fatigue, pain
Site-specific: lumps, persistent cough, changes in bowel/bladder habits, abnormal bleeding

7. Diagnosis
Clinical examination, imaging (CT, MRI, PET), biopsy, tumor markers, molecular testing, staging

8. Treatment
Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy. Multidisciplinary approach standard.

9. Current Trends
Declining mortality for many cancers
Rising incidence of some cancers (e.g., liver, thyroid)
Advanced treatment options
Screening programs effective
Health disparities persist

10. Future Projections
Precision medicine expansion
Improved immunotherapies
AI-assisted diagnosis
Expanded screening

11. Challenges
High treatment costs
Health inequities
Access barriers
Late diagnosis in some populations

12. Prevention
Tobacco control, healthy lifestyle, vaccination (HPV, Hepatitis B), screening (breast, cervical, colorectal, lung)

13. Public Health Response
National Cancer Institute, CDC programs, comprehensive cancer centers, research funding, screening initiatives

14. Summary
Cancer in America benefits from world-leading research and treatment infrastructure, though challenges remain in cost, access, and health equity.
