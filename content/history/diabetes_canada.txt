Diabetes in Canada — Full Content for AI Analysis
1. Conceptual Overview
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia from insulin dysfunction. It leads to long-term organ damage affecting cardiovascular, renal, ocular, and nervous systems.

Canada's diabetes prevalence has risen steadily, with particular concerns for Indigenous populations, immigrants from high-risk regions, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

2. Historical Evolution in Canada
Diabetes awareness and treatment advanced through the 20th century, with insulin discovered in Canada by Banting and Best in 1921. Prevalence remained relatively low until the late 20th century.

Since the 1990s, diabetes prevalence has increased significantly, driven by obesity, aging population, and lifestyle changes. Indigenous Canadians, particularly First Nations communities, experience diabetes rates 3-5 times higher than the general population.

Diabetes Canada and provincial health systems provide education, advocacy, and support services.
