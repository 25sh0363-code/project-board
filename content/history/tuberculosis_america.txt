Tuberculosis in America — Knowledge Base
1. Conceptual Overview
Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but can involve other organs. TB spreads through airborne particles and can remain latent for years.

In America, TB has transitioned from a major public health threat to a relatively controlled disease, though challenges remain in vulnerable populations.

2. Historical Evolution
TB was a leading cause of death in America through the 19th and early 20th centuries. Improved living conditions, sanatoriums, and antibiotics (streptomycin 1940s, isoniazid 1950s) dramatically reduced TB.

By the 1980s, TB declined significantly but re-emerged with HIV/AIDS epidemic and immigration. Modern TB control includes screening, treatment programs, and addressing drug-resistant TB.

3. Pathophysiology
Inhalation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Latent TB infection (bacteria contained but not eliminated) vs Active TB disease
Granuloma formation
Drug resistance when treatment incomplete

4. Clinical Manifestations
Pulmonary TB: persistent cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, hemoptysis
Extrapulmonary TB: varied symptoms depending on site

5. Transmission
Airborne droplet nuclei from active TB cases
Risk with prolonged close contact, poor ventilation, crowding

6. Diagnosis
Sputum microscopy and culture
Molecular tests (GeneXpert)
Chest X-ray
TST and IGRA for latent TB
Drug susceptibility testing

7. Treatment
6-month regimen for drug-sensitive TB
9-20 months for drug-resistant TB
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)
Latent TB treatment to prevent activation

8. Current Trends
Low incidence compared to global burden
Cases concentrated in foreign-born persons, homeless, incarcerated, HIV+ individuals
Drug-resistant TB surveillance
Strong TB control infrastructure

9. Future Projections
Continued low incidence with sustained efforts
Focus on high-risk populations
Treatment advances
Elimination goals

10. Challenges
Reaching vulnerable populations
Treatment completion
Drug-resistant TB
Social determinants of health

11. Prevention and Control
Screening of high-risk groups
Latent TB treatment
Contact investigation
Infection control
Immigration screening

12. Public Health Response
CDC TB Elimination Program
State and local TB programs
Surveillance systems
Research funding

13. Summary
TB in America is well-controlled through comprehensive public health programs, but sustained efforts are needed to maintain low incidence and address challenges in vulnerable populations toward elimination goals.
