Tuberculosis in Canada — Knowledge Base
1. Conceptual Overview
TB is chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Canada has low overall TB rates but significant disparities, with high rates in Indigenous populations.

2. Historical Evolution
TB was major cause of death historically. Antibiotic era and improved conditions reduced TB dramatically. Modern TB challenges include Indigenous populations and foreign-born residents.

3. Pathophysiology
Mycobacterial infection, latent vs active disease, granuloma formation, drug resistance

4. Clinical Manifestations
Pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB with classic symptoms

5. Transmission
Airborne transmission, increased risk with close contact and poor ventilation

6. Diagnosis
Sputum tests, imaging, molecular diagnostics, drug susceptibility testing

7. Treatment
Standard multi-drug regimens, directly observed therapy, longer treatment for drug-resistant TB

8. Current Trends
Low overall incidence
Extremely high rates in Inuit populations (among world's highest)
Elevated rates in other Indigenous groups
Cases in foreign-born populations

9. Future Projections
Elimination in Canadian-born non-Indigenous
Addressing Indigenous TB through comprehensive approaches

10. Challenges
TB in remote northern communities
Social determinants: housing, food security, healthcare access
Treatment completion in vulnerable populations

11. Prevention and Control
Screening programs
Latent TB treatment
Contact investigation
Immigration screening
Indigenous-specific programs

12. Public Health Response
Federal TB Framework
Provincial/territorial programs
First Nations and Inuit Health Branch
Surveillance systems

13. Summary
Canada addresses TB through comprehensive programs while facing challenge of extreme TB disparities in Indigenous populations, particularly Inuit communities, requiring social determinants-based approaches.
