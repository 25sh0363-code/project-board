Diabetes in China — Full Content for AI Analysis
1. Conceptual Overview
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia from insulin dysfunction, leading to organ damage.

China has the world's largest diabetes population, driven by rapid economic development, lifestyle changes, and genetic factors.

2. Historical Evolution in China
Traditional Chinese medicine recognized diabetes-like conditions. Modern diabetes emergence paralleled rapid urbanization and dietary shifts since the 1980s. Prevalence has exploded from under 1% in 1980 to over 10% by 2010s, representing a massive public health transition.

3. Pathophysiology
Type 2 Diabetes (predominant): insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction
Type 1 Diabetes: less common
Chinese populations show unique metabolic characteristics

4. Clinical Manifestations
Early: often asymptomatic, detected through screening
Established: classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss
Advanced: complications including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy

5. Non-Communicable Nature
Non-infectious. Risk factors: genetics, urbanization, dietary changes (increased sugar, refined carbs), sedentary lifestyle, obesity

6. Treatment Architecture
Lifestyle modification, oral medications (metformin, others), insulin therapy, traditional Chinese medicine integration, regular monitoring

7. Current Epidemiological Trends
Massive prevalence (over 100 million people)
Urban-rural disparities
Rising youth diabetes
Large undiagnosed population
Growing complication burden

8. Future Trends and Projections
Continued increase
Shift toward younger age groups
Technology adoption (CGM, telemedicine)
Expanded healthcare access

9. Economic and Social Impact
Enormous healthcare costs
Productivity losses
Family financial burden
Rural-urban disparities

10. Prevention Framework
Primary: lifestyle modification programs
Secondary: mass screening, early intervention
Tertiary: complication prevention

11. Public Health Strategy
National guidelines
Screening programs
Public education campaigns
Healthcare system strengthening

12. Summary
China's diabetes epidemic represents one of the world's largest health challenges, requiring comprehensive prevention, detection, treatment, and health system transformation.
