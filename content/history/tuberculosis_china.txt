Tuberculosis in China — Knowledge Base
1. Overview
TB is infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. China has world's second-largest TB burden after India.

2. Historical Context
TB historically prevalent. Despite decades of control efforts, TB remains major challenge due to large population, drug resistance, and socioeconomic factors.

3. Pathophysiology
Bacterial infection, latent vs active, drug resistance with poor treatment adherence

4. Manifestations
Pulmonary TB primary form, extrapulmonary TB

5. Transmission
Airborne, increased risk with crowding and poor ventilation

6. Diagnosis
Sputum tests, chest imaging, molecular diagnostics, drug susceptibility testing

7. Treatment
Standard regimens, directly observed therapy, drug-resistant TB requires longer treatment

8. Current Trends
Millions of cases annually
Drug-resistant TB significant concern
Rural-urban disparities
Improving detection and treatment

9. Projections
Decreasing incidence with sustained efforts
Drug resistance challenges
Healthcare strengthening

10. Challenges
Large disease burden
Drug-resistant TB
Migrant populations
Healthcare access in rural areas

11. Prevention
Screening, case finding, treatment, infection control, BCG vaccination

12. Public Health
National TB Program, free diagnosis and treatment, DOT implementation, research

13. Summary
China addresses massive TB burden through national program, free care, and sustained control efforts while managing drug resistance and geographic disparities.
