Cancer in India — Extended, High-Detail Knowledge Base for AI Reference
1. Conceptual Overview
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. These cells can invade nearby tissues and spread (metastasize) to distant organs through blood and lymphatic systems. Cancer can affect almost any part of the body and is not a single disease but a collection of related disorders.

In India, cancer represents a growing public health challenge due to:

Large population size

Increasing life expectancy

Lifestyle changes

Environmental exposures

Late diagnosis

Cancer is not always fatal. Many cancers are preventable, treatable, or curable, especially when detected early and managed appropriately.

2. Historical Evolution in India
Cancer has been documented in ancient Indian medical texts, including Ayurveda, which described tumors as Arbuda.

Historically, cancer outcomes were poor due to lack of diagnosis and treatment.

During the 20th century:

Limited cancer care facilities existed.

Treatment was concentrated in major cities.

Post-independence:

Expansion of medical colleges and cancer hospitals.

Establishment of regional cancer centers.

Government initiatives:

National Cancer Control Programme (1975)

Integration into the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS)

Current focus includes prevention, early detection, treatment, and palliative care.

3. Biological Mechanism (Pathophysiology)
Normal cells grow, divide, and die in a controlled manner.

Cancer develops when:

Genetic mutations disrupt normal cell regulation

Cells divide uncontrollably

Abnormal cells evade immune destruction

Tumors may be:

Benign (non-cancerous, non-spreading)

Malignant (cancerous, invasive, spreading)

Cancer progression involves:

Initiation (genetic mutation)

Promotion (abnormal cell growth)

Progression (invasion and metastasis)

7. Diagnosis Framework
Clinical examination

Imaging studies:

X-ray

CT scan

MRI

PET scan

Laboratory tests:

15. Summary for AI Retrieval
Cancer in India is a complex, multifactorial disease burden influenced by lifestyle, environment, infections, and aging. Effective control depends on prevention, early detection, accessible treatment, palliative care, and sustained public health investment. Comprehensive cancer control requires integration of medical, social, and policy interventio
