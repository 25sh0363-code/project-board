Tuberculosis in Australia — Knowledge Base
1. Conceptual Overview
TB is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis affecting primarily lungs. TB can remain latent or become active disease.

Australia has one of world's lowest TB rates, but challenges exist in Indigenous populations and overseas-born communities.

2. Historical Evolution
TB was common in early Australian history. Improved conditions and antibiotics reduced TB dramatically. Modern TB cases primarily in overseas-born and Indigenous populations.

3. Pathophysiology
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
Latent vs active TB
Drug resistance with incomplete treatment

4. Clinical Manifestations
Pulmonary: cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss
Extrapulmonary: varied presentations

5. Transmission
Airborne through respiratory droplets
Risk with close contact, poor ventilation

6. Diagnosis
Sputum tests, chest X-ray, molecular diagnostics, drug susceptibility testing

7. Treatment
Standard 6-month regimen
Longer for drug-resistant TB
Directly Observed Therapy
Latent TB treatment

8. Current Trends
Very low incidence
Cases mainly in overseas-born persons
Higher rates in Indigenous Australians
Strong TB control program

9. Future Projections
Maintaining low incidence
Focus on high-risk groups
Elimination strategies

10. Challenges
Reaching remote Indigenous communities
Overseas-born population screening
Treatment completion

11. Prevention and Control
Screening programs
Contact tracing
Latent TB treatment
Immigration health screening

12. Public Health Response
National TB Strategy
State and territory TB programs
Indigenous-specific programs
Surveillance systems

13. Summary
Australia maintains very low TB rates through comprehensive screening, treatment, and control programs, with particular attention to Indigenous and overseas-born populations.
