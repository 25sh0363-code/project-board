Diabetes in Australia — Full Content for AI Analysis
1. Conceptual Overview
Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin regulates blood glucose, and its dysfunction leads to organ damage affecting the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels.

Australia faces a significant diabetes burden, with particular concerns for Indigenous Australian populations who experience disproportionately high rates.

2. Historical Evolution in Australia
Diabetes recognition and management evolved through the 20th century. Historically, diabetes was relatively uncommon, but prevalence has increased substantially since the 1980s.

The rise parallels lifestyle changes, including increased obesity, sedentary behavior, and dietary shifts. Indigenous Australians have been particularly affected, with rates significantly higher than non-Indigenous populations.

Diabetes Australia and government health programs have focused on prevention, management, and reducing health disparities.
