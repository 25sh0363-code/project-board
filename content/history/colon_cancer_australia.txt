Cancer in Australia — Knowledge Base
1. Conceptual Overview
Cancer involves uncontrolled cell growth and spread. Australia has high cancer incidence partly due to UV exposure but also strong cancer care systems.

2. Historical Context
Cancer care has advanced significantly. Australia has comprehensive cancer registries, screening programs, and treatment access through universal healthcare.

3. Pathophysiology
Genetic mutations causing uncontrolled growth and potential metastasis

4. Common Types
Skin cancers (melanoma, non-melanoma) most common due to UV exposure. Also breast, prostate, colorectal, lung cancers.

5. Risk Factors
UV exposure, tobacco, alcohol, obesity, diet, physical inactivity, genetics, infections

6. Manifestations
General and site-specific symptoms

7. Diagnosis
Comprehensive diagnostic services including imaging, biopsy, molecular testing

8. Treatment
Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy. Multidisciplinary care standard.

9. Current Trends
High incidence (including skin cancers)
Improving survival rates
Strong screening programs
Advanced treatment access
Disparities for Indigenous Australians

10. Future Projections
Precision medicine, improved therapies, expanded screening

11. Challenges
Skin cancer prevention
Indigenous health disparities
Rural access
Treatment costs

12. Prevention
Sun protection, tobacco control, healthy lifestyle, vaccination, screening (breast, cervical, bowel)

13. Public Health
Cancer Australia, state cancer services, screening programs, research, SunSmart campaigns

14. Summary
Australia addresses cancer through universal healthcare, comprehensive screening, strong research, and particular focus on sun exposure prevention and Indigenous health equity.
