# Colorectal Cancer - Comprehensive Medical Information

## Overview
Colorectal cancer (CRC), encompassing cancers of the colon and rectum, is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.9 million new cases and 935,000 deaths annually (2020). CRC typically develops through a well-characterized adenoma-carcinoma sequence over 10-15 years, making it highly preventable through screening and early detection. While incidence has been declining in older adults (age 50+) due to increased screening, concerning trends show rising rates in younger adults (<50 years), prompting updated screening recommendations.

## Anatomy and Pathophysiology
**Colorectal Anatomy:**
- **Colon:** Cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon (~150 cm)
- **Rectum:** Last 15-20 cm of large intestine before anus
- **Function:** Water absorption, electrolyte balance, stool formation, microbiome habitat

**Carcinogenesis - Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence:**

*Step 1: Normal Epithelium*
- Intestinal epithelium with crypts and villi
- Rapid cell turnover (5-7 days)

*Step 2: Aberrant Crypt Foci*
- Early microscopic abnormalities
- Increased cell proliferation

*Step 3: Adenomatous Polyp*
- Benign precursor lesion
- Types: Tubular (75%), tubulovillous (15%), villous (10%) - villous has highest malignant potential
- **Dysplasia:** Low-grade → High-grade
- Size matters: <1 cm (1% cancer risk), 1-2 cm (10%), >2 cm (>40%)
- Timeline: Typically 10-15 years to progress to cancer (but can be faster)

*Step 4: Invasive Carcinoma*
- Invasion through muscularis mucosae
- Local invasion through bowel wall
- Lymph node metastasis
- Distant metastasis (liver, lung, peritoneum)

**Molecular Pathways:**

*Chromosomal Instability Pathway (CIN) - 70-85%:*
- APC gene mutation (initiating event)
- KRAS oncogene activation
- TP53 tumor suppressor loss
- Accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities
- Traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence

*Microsatellite Instability Pathway (MSI) - 15%:*
- Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency
- **Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary):** Germline MMR mutations (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2)
- **Sporadic:** MLH1 promoter hypermethylation
- Rapid progression, right-sided, better prognosis, immunotherapy responsive

*CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP):*
- Widespread gene promoter hypermethylation
- Gene silencing (including MLH1 → MSI)
- Associated with BRAF mutations, right-sided, worse prognosis if MSS

**Histological Types:**
- **Adenocarcinoma:** 95% of cases
  - Well, moderately, or poorly differentiated
  - Mucinous (10-15%): Better prognosis in early stage
  - Signet ring cell (<1%): Aggressive, poor prognosis
- **Neuroendocrine tumors:** Rare, variable behavior
- **Squamous cell carcinoma:** Rare, typically in rectum
- **Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST):** Very rare in colon/rectum

## Risk Factors
**Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**

*Age:*
- Incidence increases sharply after age 50 (90% of cases)
- Rising in younger adults (<50 years) - 10-15% of cases
- Median age at diagnosis: 67 years

*Hereditary Syndromes (5-10% of CRC):*
- **Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC):** 2-7% of CRC, 50-80% lifetime risk, early onset (40s), right-sided, MSI-H
- **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP):** <1% of CRC, APC mutation, hundreds to thousands of polyps, nearly 100% cancer risk by age 40 without colectomy
- **MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP):** Recessive, 10-100 polyps
- **Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome:** Hamartomatous polyps, increased cancer risk
- **Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome**

*Family History:*
- First-degree relative with CRC: 2-3 fold increased risk
- Multiple relatives or young age at diagnosis: Higher risk
- 20-25% of CRC has familial clustering (polygenic)

*Personal History:*
- Prior colorectal polyps or cancer
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease (duration >8-10 years, extensive colitis) - 1.5-2% risk per decade
- Prior abdominal/pelvic radiation
- Type 2 diabetes

*Race/Ethnicity:*
- African Americans: Highest incidence and mortality in US
- Ashkenazi Jews: Increased Lynch Syndrome prevalence

**Modifiable Risk Factors:**

*Lifestyle and Diet:*
- **Red meat consumption:** Processed meat especially (50g/day increases risk 18%)
- **Obesity:** BMI ≥30, particularly abdominal obesity (1.5-2 fold risk)
- **Physical inactivity:** Sedentary lifestyle
- **Smoking:** 20-30% increased risk, dose-dependent
- **Heavy alcohol consumption:** >2-3 drinks/day
- **Low fiber intake:** Protective effect of dietary fiber
- **Low calcium and vitamin D:** Protective effects suggested

*Other Factors:*
- Low vegetable and fruit intake
- High-temperature cooking of meat (carcinogens)
- Western diet pattern

## Clinical Presentation and Symptoms
**Early-Stage Disease (Often Asymptomatic):**
- Many cases detected by screening before symptoms
- Occult blood in stool

**Symptomatic Disease:**

*Right-Sided Colon Cancer (Proximal):*
- Larger luminal diameter delays obstruction
- **Iron-deficiency anemia:** Chronic occult bleeding, fatigue, pallor
- Vague abdominal pain or discomfort
- Palpable mass (advanced cases)
- Weight loss (late finding)
- Less likely to cause obstruction

*Left-Sided Colon Cancer (Distal):*
- Smaller luminal diameter
- **Change in bowel habits:** New constipation, diarrhea, alternating pattern, narrower stools ("pencil-thin")
- **Hematochezia:** Bright red blood in/on stool
- Abdominal cramping or pain
- Bowel obstruction symptoms (late): Abdominal distension, vomiting, complete constipation
- Tenesmus

*Rectal Cancer:*
- **Hematochezia:** Bright red blood, often attributed to hemorrhoids (can delay diagnosis)
- **Tenesmus:** Feeling of incomplete evacuation
- Change in bowel habits
- Pelvic pain (late, invasive disease)
- Urinary symptoms if bladder invasion
- Fistula formation (rectovaginal, rectovesical)

*Advanced/Metastatic Disease:*
- **Liver metastases:** Right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, jaundice, elevated liver enzymes
- **Lung metastases:** Cough, dyspnea, chest pain
- **Peritoneal carcinomatosis:** Ascites, bowel obstruction
- Constitutional symptoms: Fatigue, weight loss, anorexia

**Alarm Symptoms (Require Urgent Evaluation):**
- Rectal bleeding
- Iron-deficiency anemia
- Change in bowel habits (>6 weeks)
- Abdominal pain or mass
- Unintentional weight loss
- Family history of CRC or polyps

## Screening and Early Detection
**Screening Rationale:**
- Detects precancerous polyps (remove before cancer develops)
- Detects early-stage cancer (better prognosis, curable)
- Reduces incidence and mortality by 50-70%

**Screening Recommendations (Average Risk):**
- **Start age:** 45 years (updated from 50 due to rising young-onset CRC)
- **Continue until:** Age 75 (individualized 76-85, stop if >85 or <10 years life expectancy)
- **Frequency:** Depends on test modality

**Screening Modalities:**

*Structural (Visualization) Tests:*
- **Colonoscopy (Preferred):** Every 10 years
  - Entire colon visualization
  - Biopsy and polypectomy during procedure
  - Gold standard, diagnostic and therapeutic
  - Requires bowel prep, sedation
  - Small risks: Perforation (0.1%), bleeding (0.3%), cardiopulmonary events
  
- **Flexible Sigmoidoscopy:** Every 5 years (or every 10 years + annual FIT)
  - Visualizes rectum and left colon (60% of cancers)
  - Misses right-sided lesions
  - Less invasive than colonoscopy
  
- **CT Colonography (Virtual Colonoscopy):** Every 5 years
  - Non-invasive imaging
  - Requires bowel prep
  - If polyps found, need colonoscopy for removal
  - Radiation exposure, extracolonic findings

*Stool-Based Tests:*
- **Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT):** Annual
  - Detects human hemoglobin in stool
  - No dietary restrictions
  - Sensitivity 70-80% for CRC, lower for adenomas
  - Positive test requires colonoscopy
  
- **Guaiac-Based Fecal Occult Blood Test (gFOBT):** Annual
  - Less sensitive than FIT
  - Dietary restrictions needed
  - Being replaced by FIT
  
- **Multi-Target Stool DNA Test (Cologuard):** Every 3 years
  - FIT + DNA markers (KRAS mutations, methylated genes)
  - Higher sensitivity than FIT alone (92% for CRC)
  - More expensive, positive test needs colonoscopy

**High-Risk Screening:**
- **Family history:** Start age 40 or 10 years before youngest case, colonoscopy every 5 years
- **Lynch Syndrome:** Colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting age 20-25 (or 2-5 years before earliest family diagnosis)
- **FAP:** Annual flexible sigmoidoscopy starting age 10-12, colectomy recommended
- **IBD:** Surveillance colonoscopy 8-10 years after diagnosis, every 1-3 years depending on extent and inflammation

**Emerging Technologies:**
- Blood-based tests (liquid biopsy): Circulating tumor DNA, methylated markers
- Capsule endoscopy (colon capsule)

## Diagnosis and Staging
**Diagnostic Workup:**

*Colonoscopy with Biopsy:*
- Visualize tumor, assess location, size, appearance
- Biopsy for histological confirmation
- Polypectomy/biopsy of other polyps
- Tattooing site for surgical localization

*Imaging Studies:*
- **CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** Staging, assess metastases (liver, lung, lymph nodes, peritoneum)
- **MRI pelvis (for rectal cancer):** Superior soft tissue resolution, assesses depth of invasion, lymph nodes, mesorectal fascia involvement (critical for surgical planning)
- **PET-CT:** Not routine, used selectively (equivocal metastases, recurrence)

*Laboratory Tests:*
- **CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen):** Baseline, monitoring treatment response and surveillance (not diagnostic)
- Complete blood count (anemia)
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (liver function)

*Molecular/Genetic Testing (All Stage II-IV CRC):*
- **MSI/MMR status:** IHC or PCR (predicts Lynch, prognosis, immunotherapy response)
- **RAS mutations (KRAS, NRAS):** Predicts anti-EGFR therapy response (wild-type benefits)
- **BRAF V600E mutation:** Poor prognosis marker, therapeutic target
- **HER2 amplification:** Emerging therapeutic target

**Staging (TNM System - AJCC 8th Edition):**

*T (Tumor - Depth of Invasion):*
- Tis: Carcinoma in situ (intramucosal)
- T1: Invades submucosa
- T2: Invades muscularis propria
- T3: Invades through muscularis into subserosa/pericolonic tissue
- T4a: Penetrates visceral peritoneum
- T4b: Invades adjacent organs/structures

*N (Regional Lymph Nodes):*

**Prognosis by Stage (5-Year Survival):**
- Stage I: >90%
- Stage II: 80-85%
- Stage III: 50-70% (varies by substage)
- Stage IV: 10-15% (oligometastatic with resection: 30-50%)

## Treatment
**Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Medical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, pathology, gastroenterology
- Tumor board discussion for complex cases

**Treatment by Stage:**

**Stage 0-I (Early Localized):**
- **Surgery (Curative):**
  - Endoscopic resection: Polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for Tis-T1 with favorable features
  - Surgical resection if not amenable to endoscopic removal or unfavorable pathology (poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion)
  - Segmental colectomy with adequate margins (5 cm) and lymphadenectomy (≥12 nodes examined)
- **No adjuvant therapy** needed for Stage I

**Stage II (Localized, Deeper Invasion, Node-Negative):**
- **Surgery:** Segmental colectomy with lymphadenectomy
- **Adjuvant Chemotherapy:** Controversial, individualized
  - **Not routinely recommended** for low-risk Stage II (T3, MSI-H, ≥12 nodes examined, no high-risk features)
  - **Consider** for high-risk Stage II:
    - T4 tumors
    - <12 nodes examined
    - Poorly differentiated histology
    - Lymphovascular or perineural invasion
    - Bowel obstruction or perforation
    - Close/positive margins
  - Regimen: FOLFOX (5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin) or CAPOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for 6 months (or 3 months for low-risk if treating)
  - MSI-H Stage II: Excellent prognosis, may not benefit from 5-FU (even harmful?), often observe

**Stage III (Node-Positive, No Distant Metastasis):**
- **Surgery:** Segmental colectomy with lymphadenectomy
- **Adjuvant Chemotherapy (Standard of Care):**
  - Improves survival by ~30% (absolute benefit 15-20%)
  - **Regimen:**
    - FOLFOX or CAPOX for 6 months (preferred)
    - FOLFIRI (5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan) alternative if oxaliplatin contraindicated
    - 5-FU/capecitabine alone if frail or intolerant to combination
  - **Duration:** 3 months for low-risk Stage III (T1-3, N1), 6 months for high-risk (considered standard)
  - Start within 4-8 weeks post-surgery

**Stage IV (Metastatic Disease):**

*Potentially Resectable/Oligometastatic:*
- **Goal:** Curative resection of primary and metastases
- Resection of liver metastases (limited number, favorable location) ± lung metastases
- **Perioperative chemotherapy:** 
  - Neoadjuvant (downsize tumors, test biology, early systemic treatment)
  - Adjuvant (after resection, total perioperative 6 months)
- 5-year survival: 30-50% if complete resection achieved
- Consider ablation (RFA, microwave) or stereotactic radiotherapy for selected metastases

*Unresectable Metastatic:*
- **Goal:** Prolong survival, maintain quality of life, potential conversion to resectable
- **First-Line Chemotherapy:**
  - **Intensive:** FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, or FOLFOXIRI (5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin/irinotecan - most intensive)
  - **Less Intensive:** Capecitabine or 5-FU/leucovorin alone (elderly, poor performance status)
- **Targeted Therapy (Added to Chemotherapy):**
  - **Anti-VEGF (Bevacizumab):** All patients, inhibits angiogenesis
  - **Anti-EGFR (Cetuximab, Panitumumab):** RAS/BRAF wild-type, left-sided primary, more toxicity but potentially higher response
  - Choose based on RAS/BRAF status, tumor sidedness, goals of therapy
- **Second-Line and Beyond:**
  - Alternate chemotherapy backbone (FOLFOX → FOLFIRI or vice versa)
  - Continue or add different targeted therapy
  - **Regorafenib, TAS-102:** Later-line oral agents
- **Immunotherapy (For MSI-H/dMMR ~5% of metastatic CRC):**
  - **Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab ± Ipilimumab:** Checkpoint inhibitors, dramatic durable responses, first-line option
  - Superior to chemotherapy in MSI-H tumors
- **Tumor-Agnostic Therapies:**
  - **NTRK fusion:** Larotrectinib, Entrectinib (rare)
  - **HER2 amplification:** Trastuzumab + pertuzumab, trastuzumab deruxtecan
  - **BRAF V600E mutation:** BRAF inhibitor (encorafenib) + anti-EGFR (cetuximab)
- **Maintenance Therapy:** Continue 5-FU/bevacizumab after induction to reduce toxicity while maintaining benefit
- **Palliation:** Stenting or diverting ostomy for obstruction, radiation for bleeding or pain

**Rectal Cancer-Specific Treatment:**
- **Stage I (T1-2 N0):** Transanal excision (selected T1) or total mesorectal excision (TME)
- **Stage II-III (T3-4 or Node-Positive):**
  - **Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation:** Long-course (5-6 weeks) or short-course (5 days) radiation + chemotherapy
    - Downsizes tumor, increases sphincter preservation, reduces local recurrence
    - 6-8 week wait after completion (assess response)
  - **Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT):** Chemotherapy + chemoradiation before surgery (increasing standard)
    - Improves compliance, higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, addresses micrometastases early
  - **Surgery:** TME (sharp dissection of mesorectum), low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection
  - **Watch and Wait:** For complete clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy, close surveillance, organ preservation
- **Adjuvant Chemotherapy:** If not given pre-operatively (node-positive), consider if high-risk features

**Surgical Approaches:**
- **Open colectomy:** Traditional
- **Laparoscopic colectomy:** Minimally invasive, faster recovery, equivalent oncologic outcomes
- **Robotic-assisted:** Especially for rectal cancer (better pelvic visualization)
- **Stoma:** Temporary or permanent (if low rectal cancer requiring APR)

**Surgical Complications:**
- Anastomotic leak (2-5%): Major morbidity, especially rectal
- Bleeding, infection, bowel obstruction
- Long-term: Bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction (rectal surgery), stoma complications

## Complications and Side Effects
**Disease Complications:**
- Bowel obstruction (complete or partial)
- Perforation and peritonitis
- Hemorrhage
- Fistula formation
- Cachexia and malnutrition

**Treatment Side Effects:**

*Chemotherapy:*
- **5-FU/Capecitabine:** Diarrhea, mucositis, hand-foot syndrome, myelosuppression, coronary vasospasm (rare)
- **Oxaliplatin:** Peripheral neuropathy (dose-limiting, often irreversible), cold sensitivity
- **Irinotecan:** Diarrhea (early and late), myelosuppression
- **Bevacizumab:** Hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, thrombosis, impaired wound healing, bowel perforation (rare)
- **Anti-EGFR:** Acneiform rash (correlates with response), hypomagnesemia, diarrhea

*Radiation (Rectal Cancer):*
- Acute: Diarrhea, urinary frequency, skin irritation, fatigue
- Late: Bowel dysfunction (urgency, frequency), sexual dysfunction, radiation proctitis, pelvic pain

*Surgery:*
- Stoma adjustments
- Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS): Urgency, frequency, incontinence
- Sexual dysfunction: Erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, dyspareunia

## Survivorship and Follow-Up
**Surveillance (After Curative Treatment):**
- **Goals:** Detect recurrence (potentially resectable), detect new polyps/cancers
- **History & Physical:** Every 3-6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years
- **CEA:** Every 3-6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years (if Stage II-III)
- **CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:** Annually for 3-5 years (Stage II-III)
- **Colonoscopy:** 1 year post-surgery (or 1 year after pre-op colonoscopy if obstructed), then:
  - If normal: Repeat in 3 years, then every 5 years if normal
  - If advanced adenomas: Repeat in 1 year
- **Survivorship Care:** Address late effects, promote healthy lifestyle, psychosocial support

**Long-Term Effects:**
- Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
- Bowel dysfunction and dietary changes
- Body image concerns (stoma)
- Anxiety and fear of recurrence
- Fatigue
- Financial toxicity

## Prevention Strategies
**Primary Prevention:**
- **Healthy Diet:**
  - High fiber (whole grains, fruits, vegetables)
  - Limit red and processed meat
  - Adequate calcium and vitamin D
- **Maintain Healthy Weight:** BMI <25
- **Regular Physical Activity:** ≥150 min/week moderate or 75 min/week vigorous
- **Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol:** No smoking, ≤1-2 drinks/day
- **Aspirin:** Low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg) reduces CRC risk ~40% but bleeding risk must be weighed (USPSTF recommends individualized decision ages 50-59 with ≥10% 10-year ASCVD risk)

**Secondary Prevention:**
- **Screening:** Early detection and polypectomy
- **Polyp Surveillance:** Remove adenomas before cancer develops

**Tertiary Prevention:**
- Adherence to surveillance after CRC treatment
- Healthy lifestyle to reduce recurrence risk

## Special Considerations
**Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer (<50 years):**
- Increasing incidence (1-2% annually since 1990s)
- Often more advanced at diagnosis (symptoms attributed to benign causes)
- Higher proportion of rectal cancers, left-sided
- Consider hereditary syndromes (Lynch)
- Don't ignore symptoms in young adults
- Prompted lowering of screening age to 45

**Hereditary CRC Syndromes:**
- Genetic counseling and testing recommended
- Enhanced surveillance protocols
- Prophylactic surgery (FAP)
- Family cascade testing

**Lynch Syndrome Considerations:**
- Increased risk of other cancers: endometrial (40-60%), ovarian, gastric, urothelial, small bowel, brain, sebaceous tumors
- Cancer surveillance: Endometrial biopsy, consider prophylactic hysterectomy/oophorectomy

## Global Burden and Disparities
- **Incidence:** 1.9 million new cases annually worldwide
- **Mortality:** 935,000 deaths annually
- **Geographic variation:** Highest in developed countries (Australia, New Zealand, Europe, North America), increasing in transitioning countries
- **Disparities:**
  - African Americans: Highest incidence and mortality in US (25% higher mortality), younger age at diagnosis, advanced stage
  - Lower screening rates in underserved populations
  - Socioeconomic factors: Access to care, insurance, health literacy
  - Rural-urban disparities

## Future Directions and Research
- Expanding immunotherapy beyond MSI-H (combinations, convert MSS to immunogenic)
- Precision medicine: Tumor profiling, targeted therapies
- Liquid biopsies for early detection, monitoring
- Chemoprevention strategies
- Understanding young-onset CRC etiology (microbiome, diet, antibiotics?)
- Improving quality of life and survivorship care
- Reducing disparities through screening access

## Key Takeaways
Colorectal cancer is largely preventable through screening that detects and removes precancerous polyps. Early-stage disease is highly curable with surgery alone, while locally advanced disease benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic CRC, though incurable for most, has improved survival with modern chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy for MSI-H tumors. Concerning trends of rising incidence in younger adults underscore the importance of recognizing symptoms and beginning screening at age 45. Modifiable lifestyle factors offer opportunities for primary prevention. Addressing disparities in screening access and outcomes remains a critical public health priority.
