# Diabetes Mellitus - Comprehensive Medical Information

## Overview
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It affects over 537 million adults worldwide (2021), with projections reaching 783 million by 2045. Diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation, making it one of the most significant public health challenges of the 21st century.

## Classification and Types
**Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) - 5-10% of cases:**
- Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells
- Absolute insulin deficiency
- Typically diagnosed in children/adolescents (can occur at any age)
- Requires lifelong insulin therapy
- Associated with other autoimmune conditions
- Genetic predisposition (HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4)
- Environmental triggers hypothesized (viral infections)

**Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) - 90-95% of cases:**
- Insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency
- Progressive beta-cell dysfunction
- Strong association with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, age
- Typically develops in adults (increasing in youth)
- Polygenic inheritance with strong familial clustering
- Preventable through lifestyle modifications
- Initially managed with lifestyle changes, progressing to oral medications/insulin

**Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM):**
- Glucose intolerance first recognized during pregnancy
- Affects 2-10% of pregnancies
- Usually resolves postpartum but increases future T2D risk (50% within 10 years)
- Risk factors: obesity, family history, advanced maternal age, ethnicity
- Requires monitoring and management to prevent maternal/fetal complications

**Other Specific Types:**
- Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY): Monogenic forms
- Secondary diabetes: Medications (steroids), pancreatic disease, endocrine disorders
- Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes
- Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)

## Pathophysiology
**Type 1 Diabetes:**
- Autoimmune attack on pancreatic beta cells by T-lymphocytes
- Autoantibodies: Anti-GAD, anti-IA-2, anti-insulin
- Progressive beta-cell loss leading to absolute insulin deficiency
- Ketoacidosis risk without exogenous insulin
- Honeymoon period with residual beta-cell function

**Type 2 Diabetes:**
- Insulin resistance in muscle, liver, adipose tissue
- Impaired glucose uptake and excessive hepatic glucose production
- Compensatory hyperinsulinemia by beta cells
- Progressive beta-cell failure and dysfunction
- Ectopic lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity
- Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress
- Incretin hormone defects (GLP-1, GIP)
- Glucagon hypersecretion

**Metabolic Consequences:**
- Hyperglycemia: Impaired glucose utilization
- Dyslipidemia: Elevated triglycerides, low HDL, small dense LDL
- Protein glycation: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
- Endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis
- Altered mitochondrial function

## Clinical Presentation and Symptoms
**Classic Symptoms (Type 1, often acute onset):**
- Polyuria (excessive urination) due to glucosuria
- Polydipsia (excessive thirst) from dehydration
- Polyphagia (excessive hunger) despite eating
- Unintentional weight loss (muscle and fat breakdown)
- Fatigue and weakness
- Blurred vision (osmotic lens changes)
- Ketoacidosis presentation: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, Kussmaul breathing, fruity breath odor, altered consciousness

**Type 2 Diabetes (often asymptomatic, gradual onset):**
- May have no symptoms for years (diagnosed incidentally)
- Subtle symptoms: fatigue, frequent infections
- Slow wound healing
- Recurrent skin/urinary/genital infections
- Acanthosis nigricans (dark skin patches in body folds)
- Peripheral neuropathy symptoms (tingling, numbness)
- Erectile dysfunction in men

**Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar):**
- Tremors, sweating, palpitations
- Confusion, irritability, difficulty concentrating
- Hunger, dizziness, weakness
- Severe: Seizures, loss of consciousness

- Treatment: Aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin, electrolytes

**Hypoglycemia:**

## Key Takeaways
Diabetes mellitus is a complex, chronic disease requiring comprehensive management addressing glycemic control, cardiovascular risk reduction, and complication prevention. Early diagnosis, patient education, multidisciplinary care, and advances in medications (GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors) and technology (CGM, insulin pumps) have transformed diabetes care. Lifestyle modification remains foundational, and preventing type 2 diabetes through public health initiatives targeting obesity and sedentary behavior is critical for reducing the global burden of this disease.
